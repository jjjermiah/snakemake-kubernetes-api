# Design Requirements and Specifications

## Kubernetes Deployment

### Kubernetes Cluster Management and Monitoring on GCP using Terraform

This design document focuses on enhancing the system with functionalities for managing Kubernetes clusters on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) utilizing Terraform. It includes features for deploying, monitoring, deleting clusters, retrieving pod details, and viewing error logs.

### User Stories and Sub-tasks

#### Story 1: Deploy Kubernetes Clusters on GCP

**As a system administrator, I want to deploy Kubernetes clusters on GCP using Terraform to ensure consistent and scalable environments.**

##### Sub-tasks:

1. **Terraform Provider Configuration**: Investigate and configure the Terraform provider for GCP Kubernetes services.
2. **Cluster Deployment Template**: Develop Terraform templates specifying configurations for deploying Kubernetes clusters.
3. **Parameterization**: Ensure important configurations such as node sizes, cluster names, and network settings are parameterizable through Terraform variables.
4. **Deployment Script**: Create shell scripts or a simple CLI tool to facilitate easy deployment of Kubernetes clusters using the Terraform templates.

#### Story 2: Monitor Kubernetes Clusters

**As a system administrator, I want to monitor the health and status of Kubernetes clusters to maintain system reliability and performance.**

##### Sub-tasks:

1. **Terraform Monitoring Resources**: Include Terraform configurations for enabling GCP's monitoring services for Kubernetes clusters.
2. **Monitoring Dashboards**: Set up dashboards in GCP's monitoring services for real-time health and performance monitoring.
3. **Alerts Configuration**: Define and configure alerts for critical metrics thresholds to ensure proactive incident management.

#### Story 3: Delete Kubernetes Clusters on GCP

**As a system administrator, I want to delete Kubernetes clusters on GCP using Terraform to manage cluster lifecycle efficiently.**

##### Sub-tasks:

1. **Terraform Deletion Templates**: Create Terraform templates that can be invoked to delete Kubernetes clusters.
2. **Safe Deletion Scripts**: Develop scripts that perform pre-deletion checks to ensure safe decommissioning of clusters.
3. **Resource Cleanup**: Ensure all associated resources (disks, network objects, etc.) are correctly identified and cleaned up.

#### Story 4: Retrieve and View Pod Error Logs

**As a system administrator, I want to retrieve pod details and view error logs to troubleshoot issues within Kubernetes clusters effectively.**

##### Sub-tasks:

1. **Pod Retrieval Functionality**: Implement functionality to list and filter pods based on status, label, or namespace.
2. **Error Log Access**: Develop methods for accessing and fetching error logs from pods to facilitate debugging and issue resolution.
3. **Log Viewing Tool Integration**: Integrate or develop a tool to view and analyze collected pod error logs in a user-friendly manner.

### Conclusion

By addressing these user stories and completing the associated sub-tasks, the system will provide robust capabilities for deploying, monitoring, and managing Kubernetes clusters on GCP with Terraform.
Moreover, the addition of functionalities for retrieving pod details and viewing error logs will significantly enhance the system's troubleshooting and maintenance capabilities.
